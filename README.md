## A simple decision tree model for CIS 503

I have created a simple script and an interactive Jupyter Notebook which provide an example of building a decision tree model using the Titanic dataset.

The output of the model will be similar to the image below and also includes the confusion matrix and other relevant statistics for the model.

The easiest way to interact with this notebook is to use the "launch binder" button below which will launch a server where you can explore the dataset and the decision tree model. There are also links to the R documentation that includes details of how you can change and tune the model.

Once you launch the notebook, you will have access to a complete R runtime environment in notebook form.

Each codeblock is editable and runnable. To run a given code block, click into the block and use shift-return to run the code in that block. The image below is an example of a codeblock. The notebook also has other features in the menu at the top of the page.
